# Two Tables Design Recipe Template

_Copy this recipe template to design and create two related database tables from a specification._

## 1. Extract nouns from the user stories or specification

```
# EXAMPLE USER STORY:
# (analyse only the relevant part - here, the final line).

AAs a social network user,
So I can have my information registered,
I'd like to have a user account with my email address.

As a social network user,
So I can have my information registered,
I'd like to have a user account with my username.

As a social network user,
So I can write on my timeline,
I'd like to create posts associated with my user account.

As a social network user,
So I can write on my timeline,
I'd like each of my posts to have a title and a content.

As a social network user,
So I can know who reads my posts,
I'd like each of my posts to have a number of views.

```

```
Nouns:

email, username, post, title, content, views 

```

## 2. Infer the Table Name and Columns

Put the different nouns in this table. Replace the example with your own nouns.

| Record                | Properties          |
| --------------------- | ------------------  |
| accounts              | emails, usernames 
| posts                 | title, content, views 

1. Name of the first table (always plural): `accounts` 

    Column names: `email`, `unsername`

2. Name of the second table (always plural): `posts` 

    Column names: `title` , `content`, `views`

## 3. Decide the column types

[Here's a full documentation of PostgreSQL data types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype.html).

Most of the time, you'll need either `text`, `int`, `bigint`, `numeric`, or `boolean`. If you're in doubt, do some research or ask your peers.

Remember to **always** have the primary key `id` as a first column. Its type will always be `SERIAL`.

```
# EXAMPLE:

Table: accounts
id: SERIAL
email: text
username: text

Table: posts
id: SERIAL
title: text
content: text
views: int
```

## 4. Decide on The Tables Relationship

Most of the time, you'll be using a **one-to-many** relationship, and will need a **foreign key** on one of the two tables.

To decide on which one, answer these two questions:

1. Can one accounts have many posts? (Yes/No) YES
2. Can one posts have many accounts? (Yes/No) NO 

You'll then be able to say that:

1. **accounts has many posts**
2. And on the other side, posts belongs to accounts
3. In that case, the foreign key is in the table posts

Replace the relevant bits in this example with your own:

```
# EXAMPLE

1. Can one artist have many albums? YES
2. Can one album have many artists? NO

-> Therefore,
-> An artist HAS MANY albums
-> An album BELONGS TO an artist

-> Therefore, the foreign key is on the albums table.
```

*If you can answer YES to the two questions, you'll probably have to implement a Many-to-Many relationship, which is more complex and needs a third table (called a join table).*

## 5. Write the SQL

```sql
-- EXAMPLE
-- file: albums_table.sql

-- Replace the table name, columm names and types.

-- Create the table without the foreign key first.
CREATE TABLE accounts (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  email text,
  username text
);

-- Then the table with the foreign key second.
CREATE TABLE posts (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title text,
  content text,
  views int,
-- The foreign key name is always {other_table_singular}_id
  account_id int,
  constraint fk_account foreign key(account_id)
    references accounts(id)
    on delete cascade
);

```

## 6. Create the tables

```bash
psql -h 127.0.0.1 database_name < albums_table.sql
```
